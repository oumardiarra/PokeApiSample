# PokeApi Sample
This App uses MVVM pattern, set of Jetpack libraries and Retrofit to fetch data from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/) and display pokemon list on screen.
By default pokemon list is fetched and you can filter by type (ground, water, fighting....). You can check the type's list [here](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/)
